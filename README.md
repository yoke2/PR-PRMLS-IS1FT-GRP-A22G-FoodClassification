## Food Image Classification
  
---
## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Singapore is considered a food haven and a favourite national topic by many spawning popular food blogs and long queues across the island. Given the huge focus on food and growing emphasis on healthy lifestyle, there is great potential in applying Computer Vision Deep Learning techniques to food classification. In this assignment, the A22G team showcases the motivation behind the project and the effectiveness of Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks and its variants.

The team also strives to share with the reader the teamâ€™s journey to develop highly effective Deep Learning vision models while overcoming challenges like overfitting and training deep models by applying best practices. The team would also like to share empirical nuggets of wisdom gained from this journey when implementing various network architecture from scratch and techniques employed.

## SECTION 4 : USAGE GUIDE

### Running notebooks on Google Colab

The team has provided notebooks that are ready to run in Google Colab. Please see below for instructions.

1. Navigate to the [Notebooks](/Notebooks) folder
2. Within the folder, there is a Notebook Description file listing the each notebook file, a brief description for that notebook and a link to open the notebook in Google Colab
3. Click on the 'Open in Colab' icon [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)] to view the Notebook in Google Colab Playground Mode
4. To execute the notebook, you need to make a copy of it by clicking on the Copy to Drive icon and subsequently from the menu, click `Runtime > Run all`. Please note that you will need to have a Google Account to execute the notebook

### Offline install

The notebooks have been validated on Google Colab. For local run, please refer to the requirements below.  

#### System Requirements
